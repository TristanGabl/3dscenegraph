# Yes, Supervised Segmentation and Instance Segmentation techniques can achieve this. Some effective methods include:
# 	1.	Mean Shift with Labels – If you have pre-labeled points, Mean Shift clustering can refine clusters based on spatial proximity and feature similarity.
# 	2.	DBSCAN with Class Constraints – Standard DBSCAN may struggle with close objects of the same type, but using additional per-point labels as constraints can help.
# 	3.	Graph-Based Clustering – If you build a graph where nodes are points and edges represent spatial relationships, spectral clustering or connected component analysis can separate instances.
# 	4.	GNN-based Approaches – Graph Neural Networks (e.g., PointNet++, Dynamic Graph CNN) can incorporate both spatial features and labels to distinguish instances.
# 	5.	Deep Learning-Based Instance Segmentation:
# 	•	PointGroup (CVPR 2020): Groups instances in a labeled point cloud by considering both geometric proximity and semantic labels.
# 	•	Mask3D: Uses 3D instance masks to separate objects even if they are close.
# 	•	Detectron2 (Mask R-CNN for 3D): If you can project the point cloud to 2D, then back-project detected instances.

# For traditional clustering methods, adding color, intensity, or learned features to spatial coordinates improves results.
